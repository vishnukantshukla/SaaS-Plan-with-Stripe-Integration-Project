# **BreadcrumbsSaaS-Plan-with-Stripe-Integration**  
This repository provides an example of integrating Stripe for processing payments using test card details. The guide will walk you through setting up a basic payment form, processing the payment, and confirming a successful transaction.  

**Prerequisites**    
Node.js and npm installed  
Stripe account  
Stripe API keys (Publishable Key and Secret Key) 

**Setup**    
# **1. Clone the Repository**    
Clone this repository to your local machine:    

**bash**  

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stripe-integration-example.git
    cd stripe-integration-example
    
**2. Install Dependencies**  
Install the required dependencies:  

            npm install
            
**3. Configure Stripe API Keys**  
Replace your-secret-key and your-publishable-key in the server.js and index.html files with your actual Stripe API keys.  

**server.js:**  

javascript 
Copy code  
const stripe = require('stripe')('your-secret-key'); // Replace with your Stripe secret key 
public/index.html:  

javascript  
Copy code  
const stripe = Stripe('your-publishable-key'); // Replace with your Stripe publishable key 


**4. Start the Server**  
Run the following command to start the server:  

    node server.js  
    
**5. Test the Payment**  

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see a payment form. Use the following test card details to simulate a successful transaction:  

Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242  
Expiration Date: Any future date  
CVC: Any 3-digit number  
After submitting the form, you should see a message indicating that the payment was successful.
